### Data-Driven Trade Operations: Identifying $741M in Settlement Risk


## Executive Summary
This project delivers a operational risk framework that identifies settlement inefficiencies and quantifies financial exposure. By analyzing 10,000+ simulated trades, the solution pinpoints high-risk counterparties, isolates problematic instrument types, and provides actionable intelligence to reduce operational costs and trapped capital.

*Interactive Power BI dashboard providing real-time visibility into settlement performance, counterparty risk, and financial exposure.*

## Business Impact Delivered
- $741M: Total value of delayed settlements uncovered.
- $163K/day: Daily cost of delays, justifying resource focus.
- 10+ Counterparties: Flagged for high-risk (>20% delay) review.
- 60% Delay Concentration: Linked to Derivatives and FX trades.


## The Challenge
- Settlement delays represent both operational inefficiency and significant financial risk through:

- Trapped capital affecting liquidity

- Counterparty risk exposure

- Manual reconciliation costs

- Inability to prioritize remediation efforts

- **Data Generation:** Built a realistic 10,000+ trade dataset with Python, simulating T+2 cycles and 15% delay rates.
- **Analysis:** Used SQL to isolate 15% delays and $163K daily risk.
- **Reconciliation:** Simulated a counterparty statement in SQL, flagging 100% of 10% price discrepancies.
- **Visualization:** Crafted a Power BI dashboard with KPIs and trends.

## Key Findings

- Identified 10+ high-risk counterparties needing review.
- Pinpointed 60% of delays in Derivatives/FX, guiding process focus.
- Quantified $741M liquidity risk with daily $163K cost.
- Proved SQL reconciliation prevents losses by catching all breaks.


## Value Delivered
**For Operations Management:**

- Prioritized list of counterparties requiring relationship review

- Data-driven case for process improvement in Derivatives/FX settlement

- Quantitative basis for resource allocation and staffing decisions

## For Risk Management:

- Exposure concentration analysis across counterparties and products

- Monetary impact assessment of settlement inefficiencies

- Early warning system for emerging operational risk patterns

## Methodology & Assumptions
**Currency Conversion:** For the purpose of this simulation and to calculate a total monetary impact, all trade amounts were treated as if they were in USD. In a production environment, this analysis would incorporate daily foreign exchange rates to convert all currencies to a single base currency before aggregation.

### How to Explore
- **Tools:** Python 3.8+, SQL Server, Power BI

### Implementation:

- Generate trade dataset: Run data_generation.py

- Execute risk analysis:  Execute sql_analysis_queries.sql in SQL Server to replicate analysis and reconciliation.
  
- Deploy dashboard: Open visualization/operations_dashboard.pbix
